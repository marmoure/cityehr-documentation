    <title>Interactive Image Maps</title>
    <shortdesc>There are two ways in which an Entry in the clinical model can be linked to an image for data entry and several ways in which the image maps themselves can be created. This section explains how the different types of linkage work, using the sample image maps that ship with the Feature Demo application.</shortdesc>

            <p>The DAS 28 and DAS 68 forms in the Feature Demo contain examples of linking simple entries. The image map is used to set the values of Elements in the Entry.</p>

            <p>The Family History form in the Feature Demo contains an example of an image map linked to a multiple entry; each click in the image map adds another entry, with the value of an enumerated value element set through the selection in the map.</p>

            <p>There are several steps to creating a new image map for an Entry in the clinical information model:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Set the Rendition of the Entry to ImageMap</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create the SVG image map in an external file</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Upload the SVG image map, linked to the Entry</p>
