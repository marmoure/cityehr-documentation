                    <p>Move to the Administration screen by pressing the button in the top right corner of the screen. Then, move to Information Model in the Menu on the Left of the Screen. You should land on “Manage Information Model”. You will see a summary of the information models loaded for this installation (if not, press the selection to Manage Information Model in the left hand menu).</p>

                    <p>In the selection for Information Model, find the model for Specialty - cityEHR Feature Demo. This is the model that was driving the interaction with the cityEHR that you have just encountered.</p>

                    <p>The model is loaded to cityEHR as an ontology which you can browse by selecting “Feature Demo” from the Information Model drop down shown below. You can then expand the ontology by clicking the + sign. See image below.</p>

                    <p>You can browse through the ontology by expanding the tree controls - you should see the Folders, Views, Forms, Sections and Entries for the screens you have already worked with. You can select any of the loaded models and browse either as ISO-13606, data dictionary contents, class hierarchies and class nodes, depending on the type of the model (specialty or class hierarchy).</p>
