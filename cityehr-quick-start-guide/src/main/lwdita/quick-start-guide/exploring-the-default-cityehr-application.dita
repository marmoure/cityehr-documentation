            <p>Once patients are recorded in your database, you can search for them and select the desired patient to view their record or input data.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Click the <b>Patient Search</b> button in the purple system navigation pane at the top of the page to open the search form, as shown below.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Enter your search criteria and click the <b>Search</b> button at the top of the form. You can also press <b>Enter</b> after typing in any text input field. Hovering your mouse over the button will display its name.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>For test patient data, try searching using a common letter in the surname or a patient identifier. For example, entering "K" may return results if the default format for patient identifiers was used when generating the test data.</p>

                            <p>If too many patients match your criteria (e.g., searching for "Male"), you’ll be prompted to enter more specific search criteria.</p>

                    <p>When patients are found, the list will display even if only one result matches. This allows you to confirm the correct patient before viewing their record.</p>
